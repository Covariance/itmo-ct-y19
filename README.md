### How to use
I've finally finished this repository, and there's only one task missing. None of this programms were stolen from __*neerc*__ or __*e-maxx*__, though general algorithms are sometimes simillar to those described there. Most of the time I've written code in **Python 3**, but if it wasn't fast enough, I've rewritten it in **C++17**. 

Please note that those solutions are only a guideline for you, and you should __NEVER__ copypaste this code. Remember that anti-plagiarism system compares your solutions to those of previous years. I've warned you.
